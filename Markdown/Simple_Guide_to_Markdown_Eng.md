# Markdown

## Markdown - Definition

- Markdown is a simple markup language that requires a plain text.
- Markdown is commonly used in developers' blogs as a static site generator (SSG).
- Markdown is a lightweight language with plain text-based, so it doesn't have many functions to decorate the words other than to make them bold or italic.



## Markdown - Basic Syntax

### Heading

- To create a heading, add pound sign (#).
- Markdown has a Heading level 1-6.
- H1 (#) is a largest size and H6 (######) is a smallest.
- Heading Function is not for display purposes to decorate the documents. It is used for formatting only and it will skip you to a whole new paragraph or section.
- Heading  needs a space after #. 
  - i.g. '# '




### Listing

Listing is divided to Ordered List and Unordered List.



1. **Ordered List** 

- The ordered list is displayed numerically. 
- The sign for an ordered list is  `1.  `and you need space after the the sign before the line.
- **i.e.**
  - 1. Strawberry
  - 2. Plum
    2. 


2. **Unordered List**

- To create an unordered list, you can add dashes `-` , asterisks `* `, or plus signs `+ ` in front of line items and you need a space after the sign.



**Both OL and UL need a space after sign before you input something.** 

**To Breakdown in the list, you can press  `tab`.**

- **i.e.**

  - Strawberry
    - Pineberry


  - Plum
    - Aprium
    - Sugar Plum




### Code Block

1. **Fenced Code Block**

- To create FCB, you need to use **three backticks (`) sign**. 

  - i.e. (**```**) 

- FCD starts with (**```**) sign plus codetype.

- **i.e.** 

  - (**```codetype**)

  ```pyton
  print ("Hello World")
  ```

- The above is example of code to print out `Hello World` with python.



2. **Inline Code Block**

- For ICB, need to use a single backtick (**`**)
- To highlight code with ICB, you need to type a single backtick (**`**) in front and the end of the code. 
- `Print ("Hello World")`



### Link

- To create Link, type `[Name](url)`  - No space between [] and ().
- You can link not only a webpage but also images, documents, etc.
- There is an **Absolute Path** and a **Relative Path**. 
- To show or give permission to others to access or view your content, **you need to use a relative path**, not an absolute path.
- A Relative path need `./` before type the name of the file.
- **i.e.** 
  - `[Name](./Relative path.md)`
  - `[E-mail](Somebody's@email.com)`



### Blockquote

- To create a Blockquote, use a sign `>` before the line of quote.

- No need for space between `>` sign and quote line.

- i.e. 

  - > “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” — Gandhi

  - To  italicize text, either use asterisk ` *` sign, before and after the content or press  `ctrl+i`
